## 🎫 Trip Type Implementation

### One-Way Booking
- **Price**: Base route price
- **Selection**: `trip_type = "one_way"`
- **Return Date**: Not required

### Round-Trip Booking  
- **Price**: 2x base route price (automatic calculation)
- **Selection**: `trip_type = "round_trip"`
- **Return Date**: Required field
- **Validation**: Return date must be after travel date

## 💰 Automatic Price Calculation

### Backend Logic:
```python
if trip_type == "round_trip":
    form.instance.amount_paid = route_price * 2
else:
    form.instance.amount_paid = route_price
```

### Frontend Integration:
```javascript
let totalPrice = basePrice;
if (tripType === 'round_trip') {
    totalPrice = basePrice * 2;
}
```
