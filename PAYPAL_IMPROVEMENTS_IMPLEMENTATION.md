# PayPal and UI Improvements Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented 3 critical improvements to the Waka-Fine Bus booking system:

### ✅ Improvement 1: PayPal Card Input Fields
- **COMPLETED**: Added 4 new PayPal fields when PayPal is selected:
  - `card_number`: Credit/debit card number with formatting (spaces added automatically)
  - `card_owner_name`: Cardholder's full name
  - `card_cvc`: Security code (3-4 digits, numbers only)
  - `card_expiry`: Expiry date in MM/YY format (auto-formatted)
- **Database**: Added PayPal fields to Booking model with proper migrations
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all PayPal fields in forms.py
- **Auto-formatting**: JavaScript handles card number spacing and expiry date formatting

### ✅ Improvement 2: Fixed Booking Button Logic
- **COMPLETED**: Resolved booking button staying disabled when fields are complete
- **Mobile Money**: Button enables when valid phone number is entered
- **PayPal**: Button enables when all 4 PayPal fields are valid:
  - Card number: 13-19 digits
  - Owner name: Not empty
  - CVC: 3-4 digits
  - Expiry: Valid MM/YY format
- **Real-time validation**: Button state updates immediately as user types

### ✅ Improvement 3: Reorganized Field Layout
- **COMPLETED**: Moved payment input fields below payment method selection
- **Better UX**: Payment method is selected first, then relevant fields appear
- **Clean Layout**: 
  - Payment method selection → Mobile money OR PayPal fields appear
  - Only relevant fields are shown based on payment method
  - Enhanced styling with gradient backgrounds and borders

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Models (bookings/models.py)
```python
# Added PayPal fields to Booking model
card_number = models.CharField(max_length=19, blank=True, null=True)
card_owner_name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
card_cvc = models.CharField(max_length=4, blank=True, null=True)
card_expiry = models.CharField(max_length=5, blank=True, null=True)
```

### 2. Forms (bookings/forms.py)
- Added PayPal form fields with proper widgets and validation
- Enhanced `clean()` method with PayPal field validation:
  - Card number format validation
  - CVC digit validation (3-4 digits)
  - Expiry date MM/YY format validation
  - Required field validation for PayPal payments

### 3. Template (templates/bookings/create.html)
- **Reorganized layout**: Payment fields now appear below payment method selection
- **PayPal section**: Shows when PayPal is selected with all 4 fields
- **Mobile money section**: Shows when mobile money methods are selected
- **Enhanced styling**: Gradient backgrounds and improved visual hierarchy

### 4. JavaScript Enhancements
- **`handlePaymentMethodChange()`**: Shows/hides relevant payment sections
- **`arePayPalFieldsValid()`**: Validates all PayPal fields in real-time
- **`updateContinueButton()`**: Updates button state for both mobile money and PayPal
- **Auto-formatting**:
