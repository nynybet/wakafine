# QR Code Print Size Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QR Code Too Big in Print ✅
**Problem**: QR code was too large when printed (140px), causing content to be cut off
**Solution**: Added specific print sizing constraint - QR code now prints at 60px × 60px

### 2. JavaScript CSS Error ✅
**Problem**: Broken/incomplete JavaScript CSS code causing console errors
**Root Cause**: Duplicate CSS section in JavaScript that was never properly closed
**Solution**: Completely removed the duplicate JavaScript CSS section

### 3. Print Layout Issues ✅  
**Problem**: Content below QR code was getting cut off in print
**Solution**: Optimized QR size for compact printing while maintaining scannability
