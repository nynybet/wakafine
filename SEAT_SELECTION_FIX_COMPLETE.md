# Seat Selection Fix Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Resolved
**Issue**: "Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices." error when booking after seat selection.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The problem occurred because:
1. `BookingForm.__init__()` set `seat.queryset = Seat.objects.none()` initially
2. JavaScript dynamically populated seat selection without updating Django form queryset
3. When form was submitted, Django validated the seat field against an empty queryset
4. This caused validation to fail even for valid seat selections

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Form Initialization
**File**: `bookings/forms.py`
```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Set seat queryset dynamically based on bus selection
    if args and args[0]:  # If form has POST data
        bus_id = args[0].get('bus')
        if bus_id:
            try:
                bus = Bus.objects.get(id=bus_id)
                self.fields["seat"].queryset = Seat.objects.filter(
                    bus=bus, is_available=True
                )
            except (Bus.DoesNotExist, ValueError):
                self.fields["seat"].queryset = Seat.objects.none()
```

### 2. Override full_clean() Method
**File**: `bookings/forms.py`
```python
def full_clean(self):
    """Override full_clean to update seat queryset before validation"""
    # Update seat queryset based on submitted data before validation
    if hasattr(self, 'data') and self.data.get('bus'):
        try:
            bus_id = self.data.get('bus')
            bus = Bus.objects.get(id=bus_id)
            self.fields["seat"].queryset = Seat.objects.filter(bus=bus, is_available=True)
        except (Bus.DoesNotExist, ValueError):
            pass
    
    super().full_clean()
```

### 3. Enhanced Seat Validation
**File**: `bookings/forms.py`
```python
def clean_seat(self):
    """Custom validation for seat field to handle dynamic queryset"""
    seat = self.cleaned_data.get('seat')
    bus = self.cleaned_data.get('bus')
    
    if not seat:
        raise forms.ValidationError("Please select a seat.")
    
    if not bus:
        raise forms.ValidationError("Please select a bus first.")
    
    # Check if the seat belongs to the selected bus
    if seat.bus != bus:
        raise forms.ValidationError("The selected seat does not belong to the selected bus.")
    
    # Check if the seat is available
    if not seat.is_available:
        raise forms.ValidationError("The selected seat is not available.")
    
    # Update the seat queryset for this bus to prevent future validation errors
    self.fields["seat"].queryset = Seat.objects.filter(bus=bus, is_available=True)
    
    return seat
```
